# bio353's Pokédex (WIP)

### :fallen_leaf: Projeto de Banco de Dados II

This Pokédex is being created as the final project for a specific subject at my college. I'm planning to also use it, however, alongside my **custom ruleset** for [Pokerole RPG](https://www.pokeroleproject.com/).

### :rocket: What this project aims to do?

This will be a database containing information about all Pokémon, its moves and abilities, held items and pretty much everything you need to know to play like a true gamer.

Later on, I will create an entire new database exclusively for my ruleset and maybe a dice roller.
